# Burger
In this application, you will be able to create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (object-relational mapping). This uses a MVC design pattern and uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app.  Handlebars generates the HTML for the application.  Enjoy!
